### Project Overview

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/odaki/Grbl_Esp32.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/odaki/Grbl_Esp32)

This is a port of [Grbl](https://github.com/gnea/grbl) for the ESP32. The ESP32 is potentially a great target for Grbl for the following reasons

- **Faster** - At least 4x the step rates over Grbl
- **Lower Cost** - 
- **Small footprint** -
- **More Flash and RAM** - A larger planner buffer could be used and more features could be added.
- **I/O** - It has just about the same number of pins as an Arduino UNO, the original target for Grbl
- **Peripherals** - It has more timers and advanced features than an UNO.  These can also be mapped to pins more flexibly.
- **Connectivity** - Bluetooth and WiFi built in.
- **Fast Boot** - Boots almost instantly and does not need to be formally shutdown (unlike Raspberry Pi or Beagle Bone)
- **RTOS (Real Time operating System)** - Custom features can be added without affecting the performance of the motion control system.


### Using It

The code should be compiled using the latest Arduino IDE. [Follow instructions here](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) on how to setup ESP32 in the IDE. The choice was made to use the Arduino IDE over the ESP-IDF to make the code a little more accessible to novices trying to compile the code.

I use the ESP32 Dev Module version of the ESP32. I suggest starting with that if you don't have hardware yet.

For basic instructions on using Grbl use the [gnea/grbl wiki](https://github.com/gnea/grbl/wiki). That is the Arduino version of Grbl, so keep that in mind regarding hardware setup. If you have questions ask via the GitHub issue system for this project.

### Roadmap

The roadmap is now [on the wiki](https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32/wiki/Development-Roadmap).

### Credits

The original [Grbl](https://github.com/gnea/grbl) is an awesome project by Sungeon (Sonny) Jeon. I have known him for many years and he is always very helpful. I have used Grbl on many projects. I only ported because of the limitation of the processors it was designed for. The core engine design is virtually unchanged.

The Wifi and WebUI is based on [this project.](https://github.com/luc-github/ESP3D-WEBUI)
