    Part of Grbl_ESP32

    Pin assignments (or lack thereof) for testing Grbl_ESP32.

    It creates a basic 3 axis machine without actually driving
    I/O pins.  Grbl will report that axes are moving, but no physical
    motor motion will occur.

    This can be uploaded to an unattached ESP32 or attached to
    unknown hardware with no risk of pins trying to output signals
    into a short, etc that could dmamge the ESP32

    It can also be used to get the basic program running so OTA
    (over the air) firmware loading can be done.
