# Google test code

These unit tests are designed to test a small portion of the GRBL_ESP32
code, directly from your desktop PC. This is not a complete test of 
GRBL_ESP32, but a starting point from which we can move on. Testing and 
debugging on a desktop machine is obviously much more convenient than 
it is on an ESP32 with a multitude of different configurations, not to
mention the fact that you can use a large variety of tools such as 
code coverage, profiling, and so forth.

Code here is split into two parts:
1. A subset of the GRBL code is compiled. Over time, this will become more.
2. Unit tests are executed on this code.

## Prerequisites

Google test framework.

## Folders and how this works

Support libraries are implemented that sort-of mimick the Arduino API where
appropriate. This functionality might be extended in the future, and is by 
no means intended to be or a complete or even a "working" version; it's 
designed to be _testable_.

Generally speaking that means that most features are simply not available. 
Things like GPIO just put stuff in a buffer, things like pins can be logged
for analysis and so forth. 

The "Support" folder is the main thing that gives this mimicking ability,
so that the code in the Grbl_Esp32 folder is able to compile. For example,
when including `<Arduino.h>`, in fact `Support/Arduino.h` is included.

The include folders that have to be passed to the x86/x64 compiler are:

- X86TestSupport
- ..\Grbl_Esp32

## Test code

Google tests can be found in the `Tests` folder.
