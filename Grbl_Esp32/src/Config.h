// ADVANCED CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:

// Configure rapid, feed, and spindle override settings. These values define the max and min
// allowable override values and the coarse and fine increments per command received. Please
// note the allowable values in the descriptions following each define.

    const int Default         = 100;  // 100%. Don't change this value.
    const int Max             = 200;  // Percent of programmed feed rate (100-255). Usually 120% or 200%

    const int ExtraLow = 5;    // Percent of rapid (1-99). Usually 5%.  Not Supported
};

namespace SpindleSpeedOverride {
    const int Default         = 100;  // 100%. Don't change this value.
    const int Max             = 200;  // Percent of programmed spindle speed (100-255). Usually 200%.

// When a M2 or M30 program end command is executed, most GCode states are restored to their defaults.
// This compile-time option includes the restoring of the feed, rapid, and spindle speed override values
// to their default values at program end.

// Some status report data isn't necessary for realtime, only intermittently, because the values don't
// change often. The following macros configures how many times a status report needs to be called before
// the associated data is refreshed and included in the status report. However, if one of these value
// changes, Grbl will automatically include this data in the next status report, regardless of what the
// count is at the time. This helps reduce the communication overhead involved with high frequency reporting
// and agressive streaming. There is also a busy and an idle refresh count, which sets up Grbl to send
// refreshes more often when its not doing anything important. With a good GUI, this data doesn't need
// to be refreshed very often, on the order of a several seconds.
// NOTE: WCO refresh must be 2 or greater. OVR refresh must be 1 or greater.

// The temporal resolution of the acceleration management subsystem. A higher number gives smoother
// acceleration, particularly noticeable on machines that run at very high feedrates, but may negatively
// impact performance. The correct value for this parameter is machine dependent, so it's advised to
// set this only as high as needed. Approximate successful values can widely range from 50 to 200 or more.
// NOTE: Changing this value also changes the execution time of a segment in the step segment buffer.
// When increasing this value, this stores less overall time in the segment buffer and vice versa. Make
// certain the step segment buffer is increased/decreased to account for these changes.

// Minimum planner junction speed. Sets the default minimum junction speed the planner plans to at
// every buffer block junction, except for starting from rest and end of the buffer, which are always
// zero. This value controls how fast the machine moves through junctions with no regard for acceleration
// limits or angle between neighboring block line move directions. This is useful for machines that can't
// tolerate the tool dwelling for a split second, i.e. 3d printers or laser cutters. If used, this value
// should not be much greater than zero or to the minimum value necessary for the machine to work.
const double MINIMUM_JUNCTION_SPEED = 0.0;  // (mm/min)

// Sets the minimum feed rate the planner will allow. Any value below it will be set to this minimum
// value. This also ensures that a planned motion always completes and accounts for any floating-point
// round-off errors. Although not recommended, a lower value than 1.0 mm/min will likely work in smaller
// machines, perhaps to 0.1mm/min, but your success may vary based on multiple factors.

// Number of arc generation iterations by small angle approximation before exact arc trajectory
// correction with expensive sin() and cos() calcualtions. This parameter maybe decreased if there

// bogged down by too many trig calculations.

// The arc G2/3 GCode standard is problematic by definition. Radius-based arcs have horrible numerical
// errors when arc at semi-circles(pi) or full-circles(2*pi). Offset-based arcs are much more accurate
// but still have a problem when arcs are full-circles (2*pi). This define accounts for the floating
// point issues when offset-based arcs are commanded as full circles, but get interpreted as extremely
// small arcs with around machine epsilon (1.2e-7rad) due to numerical round-off and precision issues.
// This define value sets the machine epsilon cutoff to determine if the arc is a full-circle or not.
// NOTE: Be very careful when adjusting this value. It should always be greater than 1.2e-7 but not too
// much greater than this. The default setting should capture most, if not all, full arc error situations.
const double ARC_ANGULAR_TRAVEL_EPSILON = 5E-7;  // Float (radians)

// Time delay increments performed during a dwell. The default value is set at 50ms, which provides
// a maximum time delay of roughly 55 minutes, more than enough for most any application. Increasing
// this delay will increase the maximum dwell time linearly, but also reduces the responsiveness of
// run-time command executions, like status reports, since these are performed between each dwell
// time step. Also, keep in mind that the Arduino delay timer is not very accurate for long delays.
const int DWELL_TIME_STEP = 50;  // Integer (1-255) (milliseconds)

// Serial send and receive buffer size. The receive buffer is often used as another streaming
// buffer to store incoming blocks to be processed by Grbl when its ready. Most streaming
// interfaces will character count and track each block send to each block response. So,
// increase the receive buffer if a deeper receive buffer is needed for streaming and avaiable
// memory allows. The send buffer primarily handles messages in Grbl. Only increase if large
// messages are sent and Grbl begins to stall, waiting to send the rest of the message.
// NOTE: Grbl generates an average status report in about 0.5msec, but the serial TX stream at
// 115200 baud will take 5 msec to transmit a typical 55 character report. Worst case reports are
// around 90-100 characters. As long as the serial TX buffer doesn't get continually maxed, Grbl
// will continue operating efficiently. Size the TX buffer around the size of a worst-case report.
// #define RX_BUFFER_SIZE 128 // (1-254) Uncomment to override defaults in serial.h
// #define TX_BUFFER_SIZE 100 // (1-254)

// Writing to non-volatile storage (NVS) can take a long time and interfere with timely instruction
// execution, causing problems for the stepper ISRs and serial comm ISRs and subsequent loss of
// stepper position and serial data. This configuration option forces the planner buffer to completely
// empty whenever the NVS is written, to prevent any chance of lost steps.
// It doesn't prevent loss of serial Rx data, especially if a GUI is premptively filling up the
// serial Rx buffer.  GUIs should detect GCodes that write to NVS - notably G10,G28.1,G30.1 -
// and wait for an 'ok' before sending more data.
// NOTE: Most setting changes - $ commands - are blocked when a job is running. Coordinate setting
// GCode commands (G10,G28/30.1) are not blocked, since they are part of an active streaming job.
// This option forces a planner buffer sync only with such GCode commands.
const bool FORCE_BUFFER_SYNC_DURING_NVS_WRITE = true;  // Default enabled. Comment to disable.

// In Grbl v0.9 and prior, there is an old outstanding bug where the `WPos:` work position reported
// may not correlate to what is executing, because `WPos:` is based on the GCode parser state, which
// can be several motions behind. This option forces the planner buffer to empty, sync, and stop
// motion whenever there is a command that alters the work coordinate offsets `G10,G43.1,G92,G54-59`.
// This is the simplest way to ensure `WPos:` is always correct. Fortunately, it's exceedingly rare
// that any of these commands are used need continuous motions through them.
const bool FORCE_BUFFER_SYNC_DURING_WCO_CHANGE = true;  // Default enabled. Comment to disable.

// By default, Grbl disables feed rate overrides for all G38.x probe cycle commands. Although this
// may be different than some pro-class machine control, it's arguable that it should be this way.
// Most probe sensors produce different levels of error that is dependent on rate of speed. By
// keeping probing cycles to their programmed feed rates, the probe sensor should be a lot more
// repeatable. If needed, you can disable this behavior by uncommenting the define below.
const bool ALLOW_FEED_OVERRIDE_DURING_PROBE_CYCLES = false;

// Configure options for the parking motion, if enabled.
#define PARKING_AXIS Z_AXIS                      // Define which axis that performs the parking motion
