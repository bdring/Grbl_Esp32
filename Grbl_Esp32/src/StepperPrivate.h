// Define Adaptive Multi-Axis Step-Smoothing(AMASS) levels and cutoff frequencies. The highest level
// frequency bin starts at 0Hz and ends at its cutoff frequency. The next lower level frequency bin
// starts at the next higher cutoff frequency, and so on. The cutoff frequencies for each level must
// be considered carefully against how much it over-drives the stepper ISR, the accuracy of the 16-bit
// timer, and the CPU overhead. Level 0 (no AMASS, normal operation) frequency bin starts at the
// Level 1 cutoff frequency and up to as fast as the CPU allows (over 30kHz in limited testing).
// For efficient computation, each cutoff frequency is twice the previous one.
// NOTE: AMASS cutoff frequency multiplied by ISR overdrive factor must not exceed maximum step frequency.
// NOTE: Current settings are set to overdrive the ISR to no more than 16kHz, balancing CPU overhead
// and timer accuracy.  Do not alter these settings unless you know what you are doing.
