// #include "Machines/3axis_v4.h"

// === OEM Single File Configuration Option
// OEMs that wish to publish source code that is configured for a
// specific machine may put all of their configuration definitions
// directly in this file, without including any other file above.

#else

// By using the external environment to define MACHINE_FILENAME,
// a configuration can be chosen without editing this file.
// That is useful for automated testing scripts.
//
// For example, when using the platformio compilation environment
// under Linux, you could issue the following command line:
//   PLATFORMIO_BUILD_FLAGS=-DMACHINE_FILENAME=3axis_v4.h platformio run
//
// Under Windows, using PowerShell, the command would be:
//   $env:PLATFORMIO_BUILD_FLAGS='-DMACHINE_FILENAME=3axis_v4.h'; platformio run
//
// When using the Arduino IDE, there is no easy way to pass variables
// to the compiler, so this feature is not useful for Arduino.
//
// MACHINE_FILENAME must not include the Machines/ path prefix; it is
// supplied automatically.

// MACHINE_PATHNAME_QUOTED constructs a path that is suitable for #include
#define MACHINE_PATHNAME_QUOTED(name) <Machines/name>
