Please answer the following questions.

What version of the firmware are you using?

Is the problem repeatable?

Under what conditions does the bug occur?

**Important** If you paste firmware code, please use [Markdown Code and Syntax Highlighting](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code) with language C++. Use the three back tick method.
